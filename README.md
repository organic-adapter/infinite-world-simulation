How would you combine, a simulated farm in Nebraska, with results from a classic DND RPG together?

# Cloud Solutions
We are going to combine infrastructure at some point. AWS will handle primarily the Top Level Domains (Core Domains) that will run the world simulation. I plan on using Azure for stand alone systems that feed into the world simulation.

I still haven't looked at GCP yet, if we were to integrate anything it would be the Docs suite.
